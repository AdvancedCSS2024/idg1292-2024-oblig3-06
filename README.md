Read me - Group 06

We chose UN sustainable goal number 15 â€“ Life On Land
(The reasearch was done mainly on https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15)

As a group we decided this would be an interesting and relevant goal for this circumstance. We started by briefly sketching out some ideas about what story we wanted to tell. First we used sketches and brainstorming to come up with ideas quick, that we could further develop later in the process.

The Idea.
Our story landed on a group of friends heading to vacation, on their way they see different environments along the way. Although they see out of the car, they are mostly focused on getting to their destination. In the car the radio is playing, and a radio host starts talking about different things to put to consideration when being a tourist this summer. The group drive by different kinds of environments, corresponding to the things the radio host tries to communicate. This puts everything into perspective for the friend group, because when they arrive to their destination, the environment is gorgeous. Therefore, they understand the importance of being a thoughtful tourist and leaving the nature the way you found it. 

Creating the components.
The layout and theme were sketched out in illustrator. There we extracted the svgs we needed to make a cohesive design. Some of the components is downloaded from Adobe Stock (royalty free designs), but it is mostly conducted by us. After the svg components where created, we mocked up a storyboard with all the different scenes and how we ideally wanted it to look. This gave us an overview of the story and components while coding.  We found it easiest to create a long svg with the corresponding parts of the different scenes. It made a lot more effective in the code and the overall look was a bit cleaner in our case. 

Html structure.

Positioning and responsiveness.
For positioning, we created one div called Container, which defines the whole space where the scrollytelling takes place, and within this div, we creted an section. One of these is the SVG-container, which holds all the different SVG's. We made the SVG with the palms, and bushes one long one, so it gives the illusion that the car is moving forwards. With the right use of "wv", "vh", and "%" when sizing and positioning the images, the page is pretty responsive without us having to do much extra. Just some media queries that defines the length of the container, which differs from different screen sizes.
